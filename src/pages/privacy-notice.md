## Applicability of this privacy notice

This Privacy Notice applies only to information provided and collected through the Site. It does not apply to information that we or others may collect through other means, such as information we may learn through a business or employment relationship with you, or information you may provide to us through any other website, mobile application, or online service we own or operate.

Some products and services offered via the Site are subject to additional privacy notices, and this Privacy Notice does not apply to those. For example, we provide our customers with an end-to-end user authentication platform, provided using a cloud-based platform-as-a-service model. If you become our customer by enrolling to receive services from us, you will be required to enter into a separate services agreement (the “Services Agreement”) containing the specific terms and restrictions relating to such services. The Services Agreement, and not this Privacy Notice, will govern and control our privacy practices with respect to information we receive in the course of that customer relationship. In addition, to the extent any person provides information to one of our customers using our services, that customer’s information collection and privacy practices will be subject to the customer’s own privacy notices, and we are not responsible for their information collection and privacy practices.

This Privacy Notice also does not apply to, and we are not responsible for the information collection practices of, any third-party services, websites, apps, tools, or plug-ins, even if we provide links to them on or through the Site. All third-party features are subject to the privacy practices of the party providing such features, and we encourage you to review the privacy notices provided by the applicable third party.

## Updates to this privacy notice

Because of changes in internet technology and practices, this Privacy Notice may change from time to time. We will post any changes we make to this Privacy Notice on this page, and any changes will be effective once the new notice is posted. It is your responsibility to check this Privacy Notice for updates. You will be able to determine when this Privacy Notice was last updated by referring to the “Last Modified” legend at the top. By using the Site after we post any changes to this Privacy Notice, you agree to accept those changes, whether or not you have reviewed them.

## How we collect and use your personal information

### A. What is personal information?

Personal information refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify a particular person. Different countries, states, and laws define personal information (and similar terms, such as personal data and personally identifiable information) to include different things, but it generally includes information such as your name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. It may also include your computer or mobile device IP address, if that IP address can be linked to a specific person.

### B. Your choices about sharing your personal information

You are generally in control of whether you provide us with any personal information. For example, you can visit and view our website without disclosing any personal information about yourself. Although using our Site may result in our obtaining your IP address and browsing behavior, we do not use that information by itself to personally identify you. If you do not wish to provide particular information, you should not use the Site, or otherwise provide your information. That will affect our ability to interact with you; however, that is your choice.
